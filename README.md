  ls 
  cd holbertonschool-printf
  ./name_file.c
```


## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  editors: vi, vim, emacs
 compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 

  using gcc, -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

   checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
   ./name.c
```


## Parameters
` The next chart explains the detailed functionality of the parameters that the function accepts, respectively with each data type. `


Indicator	Data type	Description 

%d =	int	Print an int as a signed decimal number

%i =	int	Print an int as a signed decimal number

%u =	int	Print an unsigned as an unsigned decimal number

%o =	int	Print an unsigned as an unsigned octal number

%x =	int	Hexadecimal notation (using lowercase letters a-f)

%X =	int	Hexadecimal notation (using uppercase letters A-F)

%c =	int	Convert an int to an unsigned character and print the resulting character

%s =	char *	Print a string pointed to by a char *

%p =	void *	Print a void * argument in hexadecimal (ANSI C only)

%% =	char	Print a single % character

%b =	int	Print a converted number to binary (base 2)

%r =	char *	Print a reversed string

%R =	char *	Converts a string to rot13 and prints it

` Here's an example of how does the parameters work in our _printf() function: `


#include "main.h"

int main()
{
    _printf("Cohort: %i", 19);
    return (0);
}

`The output of this main function will be:`

$ ./main.out
Cohort: 19
